# Common Voice Audio Denoising Dataset Generation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to generate a dataset of noisy audio samples based on Mozilla's Common Voice dataset. The generated dataset can be used to train and evaluate audio denoising models.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create noisy variants of clean audio recordings from the Common Voice dataset. By systematically introducing different types and levels of noise, the generated dataset can be used by researchers and developers working on audio denoising technologies.
